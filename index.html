Comparison and logical operators:

comparison:


you can evaluate a situation by comparing one value in the script to what you expect it might be. the result will be a boolean: true anf false.
At the most basic level, you can evaluate two variables using a comparison operator to return a t rue or f alse value. 
In this example, a user is taking a test, and the script tells the user whether they have passed this round of the test. 

In the comparison operator, the operand on the left calculates the user's total score. The operand on the right adds together the highest scores for each round. The result is then added to the page. 
When you assign the result of the comparison to a variable, you do not strictly need the containing parentheses



logical operators:


comparison operators usually return single values of turn of false.
logical operators allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator.


loops:
loops check a condition. if it returns true, a code block will run.
then the condition will be checked again and if it still returens true, the code block will run again. it repeats until the condition returns false.
and there are three common types of loops:
- (FOR).
- (WHILE).
-(DO WHILE).
